### Animation, 3D & UI/UX toolkit

I love making interfaces feel alive — smooth motion, micro-interactions and immersive 3D when it fits the user story. Tools & libraries I use:

![Three.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Three.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=three.js&logoColor=white)
![GSAP](https://img.shields.io/badge/GSAP-29ABE2?style=for-the-badge&logo=greensock&logoColor=white)
![Lottie](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lottie-LottieFiles-FF6A00?style=for-the-badge&logo=lottiefiles&logoColor=white)
![Blender](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blender-F5792A?style=for-the-badge&logo=blender&logoColor=white)

Tips for adding animation/3D to your projects:
- Use Lottie for lightweight vector animations that scale well in apps and web.
- Host interactive demos (Three.js) on a small static site and link/embed screenshots here.
- Prefer transforms and GPU-accelerated properties for smooth motion (translateZ, transform, opacity).

You can turn these into a little animated strip by hosting small GIFs or using SVG icons — this is a simple, reliable start.

### Projects

- [Scheme Recommendation System](https://github.com/Grimprogs/Scheme_Recommendation_System) — Flask + Neo4j demo for recommending social schemes.

### GitHub Stats (optional)

Below are live stats already wired to the `Grimprogs` username.

![Your GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Grimprogs&show_icons=true&theme=default)

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Grimprogs&layout=compact)

If you want these to render for a different username, replace the `username=` parameter in the URLs above or create a new repo named with your GitHub username and copy this README there.

### How to use this template

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named exactly with your username, e.g. `your-username`.
2. Clone that repo locally (or use the web editor).
3. Copy this file into the root of the new repo and rename to `README.md`.
4. Replace `YOUR_NAME` and `YOUR_USERNAME` and adjust badges/links.
5. Commit and push. Your GitHub profile page will then display this README.

Optional: Add GitHub Actions for dynamic badges or a GIF builder. If you want, I can add a ready-to-use workflow to keep your GitHub stats refreshed.

---

Good luck — tell me your GitHub username and I can inline-edit this file replacing placeholders for you, or add an optional Actions workflow to show a live animated tech-stack card.
